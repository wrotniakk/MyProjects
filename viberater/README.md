### Personal Excel project - mood dynamic tracker and visualizer

The project is about personally tracking subjective mood evaluation (scale 1-10). After leaving such an entry in the table, other sheets take average daily and monthly moods and visualize it as a line chart. There is also an option of filtering the entries based on several variables (day, month, mood score etc)

The entries span from January 2021 to June 2021
